1,Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  
1,The rest of the cast also play well.  
1,Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.

0,About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
0,By the time the film ended I not only disliked it I despised it.  
0,What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
0,The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
0,Things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  
1,The cast is good.  
1,For that it's worth checking out.  
0,This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  
0,It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  
0,Everything about it is just bad.  
0,I could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
0,The script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  
0,The casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors period.  
0,Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  
0,It is zillion times away from reality.

0,Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  
0,20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
0,Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  
0,From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  
0,His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  
0,And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
0,Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
0,(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
0,there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
1,the cast was great.  
1,steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged upper class uptight white guy.  
1,add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
0,but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
0,first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  
0,the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  
0,putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  
0,there is no real plot.  
0,i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
1,STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  
1,This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  
1,While you don't yet hear Mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  
1,However after seeing the short again after about 25 years I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  
1,"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  "
1,Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  
0,The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  
0,I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
1,The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  
1,John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  
0,I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
0,This may be the only bad film he ever made.  
0,So bad...well...it's just bad.  
0,This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way.  
0,It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
0,I thought it was bad.  
0,Both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable.  
0,Let's start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad.  
0,The script is a big flawed mess.  
0,The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
0,"Director Paul Matthews who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"" clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  "
0,The movie is terribly boring in places.  
0,The lighting is awful.  
0,The film looks cheap and bland.  
0,One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
0,This convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here.  
0,The visual effects were AWFUL.  
0,The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  
0,"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  "
1,Okay I like to consider myself a fair critic so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  
1,Gotta love those close-ups of slimy drooling teeth!  
0,"To sum the film up ""Breeders"" is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  "
0,Not recommended.  
0,He is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing.  
0,Aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits.  
0,I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
0,Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  
1,The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  
0,With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer.  
0,The budget was evidently very limited.  
0,This was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below-par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
0,However here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up.  
0,Filmiing was less expansive.  
0,It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
0,Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
0,Not recommended.  
0,Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
0,There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
0,Even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep.  
0,Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash -period!  
0,I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  
0,Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  
1,Being a 90's child I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  
1,"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created.  "
1,The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
1,Easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  
1,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
1,Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  
0,Every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  
0,Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well... talk.  
1,Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  
0,There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
0,I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
0,What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  
0,To be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  
0,In conclusion I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  
0,The story line is just awful!  
0,It's just painful!  
0,And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  
0,There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
0,Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
1,I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  
1,The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  
1,Go watch it!  
0,Omit watching this.  
1,VERY funny!  
0,My rating: just 3 out of 10.  
1,The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  
1,An instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  
1,Don't miss it.  
1,This is a masterful piece of film-making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  
1,A mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  
1,But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close-up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold.  
1,It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  
0,The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
0,Regardless the film fails on most levels.  
0,Avoid at all costs.  
1,I saw this film over Christmas and what a great film it was!  
1,I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  
1,His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  
1,I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and I grew up watching his films as a child.  
1,But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
1,I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  
0,I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but George was well dull.  
0,He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests.  
1,Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  
1,Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white low-budget original.  
1,Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  
1,I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
1,Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  
1,But it is entertaining nonetheless.  
1,It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
1,There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  
1,The cast is always entertaining as usual.  
1,Overall a delight!  
0,This movie is so mind-bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created.  
0,The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  
0,The least said about the acting the better.  
1,This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  
1,I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  
1,Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
1,The acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent view or see.  
1,Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  
1,Excellent performance.  
1,There still are good actors around!  
1,Also great directing and photography.  
1,Very true to Shakespear and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  
1,Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting.  
1,Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  
1,If you love death and decay and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  
1,This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  
1,Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  
1,"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  "
1,Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  
0,Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series) this is baaaaaad.  
0,"Unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of Austen's work you can skip this one.  "
1,If you do watch it however there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  
0,It is not good.  
0,Speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
0,Then the film just dropped the ball.  
1,This is a stunning movie.  
1,Raw and sublimely moving.  
1,It felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  
1,All of the main players are mesmerising.  
1,Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  
1,Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  
1,He's a national treasure.  
1,GO AND SEE IT!  
1,This is an excellent film.  
1,The aerial scenes were well-done.  
1,It was also the right balance of war and love.  
1,"The film gives meaning to the phrase ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  "
1,Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  
1,A good film by a great director!  
1,This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  
0,There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  
1,This is just a great movie.  
1,10 out of 10 stars.  
0,I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
0,It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
1,Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  
1,Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style Watkins creates a film like no other.  
1,This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  
1,I advise you to look out for it.  
1,You wont regret it!  
1,Highly recommended A+  
0,Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
0,It's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  
0,It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
0,) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time.  
0,It is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  
0,How awful she is!  
0,But she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  
0,The results well are a shame.  
0,DELETE this film from your mind!  
0,One of the worst shows of all time.  
0,The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  
0,The fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad-ass girl who are these actors???  
0,Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  
0,"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  "
0,The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
0,Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
1,Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  
1,The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  
1,The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  
0,Im big fan of RPG games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  
0,The lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong.  
0,You can find better movies at youtube.  
0,Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes.  
0,"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  "
0,That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
0,So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  
0,"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
0,It's an empty hollow shell of a movie.  
0,Seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on.  
0,Avoid avoid avoid!  
0,It will drive you barking mad!  
1,The transfers are very good.  
1,Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  
1,The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  
1,) some great music and terrific scenery.  
1,It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has (shocking spoiler here!  
1,) a happy wonderful feel good ending!  
1,The point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family.  
1,It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
0,Nothing new there.  
0,That was done in the second movie.  
0,The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
0,The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  
0,What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
1,I just saw this film and I recommend it.  
1,It has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  
1,A very good film indeed about great and unconditional love.  
1,Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  
1,Emily Watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  
1,Despite the pans of reviewers I liked this movie.  
1,In fact I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  
1,Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  
1,I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style sensitivities and treatments.  
1,I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  
0,The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  
1,But I thought his acting was skilled.  
1,Meredith M was better than all right.  
1,A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  
1,It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
1,Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  
1,This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  
1,This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  
1,A standout scene.  
0,This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
0,Technically the film is well made with impressive camera-work solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  
1,It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  
1,The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  
1,I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  
1,This movie is also revealing.  
1,Personally I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  
0,And it was boring.  
0,I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast.  
1,PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  
1,It's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect.  
1,"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small great film"" and that's right.  "
1,All the actors give a wonderful performance especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  
1,You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself.  
1,"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  "
1,Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  
1,You won't forget this movie!  
0,Why was this film made?  
0,The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  
0,The result is a film that just don't look right.  
0,None of them are engaging or exciting.  
0,The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  
0,The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  
1,"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973 when it was ""The Stranger"" and I loved it.  "
1,But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  
1,This movie is so awesome!  
1,I loved it it was really scary.  
1,I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  
1,If you want a real scare rent this one!  
1,This is an extraordinary film.  
1,As a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the American justice system it's frightening.  
1,This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court.  
1,The film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  
1,This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  
1,Predictable but not a bad watch.  
1,It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  
1,She carries the movie well.  
1,Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  
1,It is wonderful and inspiring to watch and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  
0,How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc...it's ALL wrong.  
0,In fact this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  
0,Avoid at ALL costs!  
0,Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  
0,The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  
0,The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
0,The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
0,The worst one of the series.  
1,Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
1,When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song Old Man by Neil Young was played which evokes many emotions.  
1,Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  
1,Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film.  
1,This film offers many delights and surprises.  
1,"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  "
1,The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  
1,You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  
1,But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  
1,The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  
1,You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  
1,The acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch.  
1,The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly Grimes and Blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
1,Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  
1,Conclusion - I loved it.  
1,It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
1,I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
1,Mark my words this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line.  
1,It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  
1,The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  
1,Plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job!  
1,Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  
1,Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  
1,See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  
1,See both films if you can.  
1,"It was that year however that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "
1,Feelings thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  
0,Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  
0,It's very slow.  
0,Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  
0,) Don't waste your time.  
0,End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  
0,He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  
0,This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  
0,I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  
1,This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  
1,It has everything you could want... suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all end-all of brainsucking movies look no further.  
1," With great sound effects and impressive special effects I can't recommend this movie enough.  	"
1,Call me a nut but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  
1,Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  
0,1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  
0,Lots of holes in the script.  
0,It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  
0,Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  
0,The dialogue is atrocious.  
0,The acting is beyond abysmal.  
0,Everything stinks.  
0,Trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on.  
0,Worse there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  
0,It's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time.  
0,In short don't bother with this movie.  
1,I won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing.  
1,The best scene in the movie is at the end but I won't spoil it.  
1,If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it!  
1,The result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  
1,A film not easily forgotten.  
1,But Kevin Spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  
1,The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  
1,The characters are interesting even if a bit predictable.  
1,Highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  
1,Great movie!  
0,Also the story and acting were weak.  
0,At around 4 pm I bought it at around 8pm I started to watch at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  
0,Either way it sucks.  
0,The script is horrendously stupid.  
0,The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  
0,Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  
0,What the hell kind of crap is that?!  
0,Then there's the plot holes.  
0,You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  
1,Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  
1,She's poised and amazing.  
0,Dee Snider just plain sucks.  
0,He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen) he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  
0,I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  
0,The acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special FX suck the directing sucks... basically this movie sucks.  
0,This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  
0,This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  
0,A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  
0,Avoid at any and all costs.  
0,At any rate this film stinks its not funny and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  
0,Avoid this film at all costs.  
0,I don't know what happened in Season Five what a mess.  
0,The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  
0,Now this is a movie I really dislike.  
0,It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  
0,The puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  
0,The story is lame not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  
0,There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  
0,I felt asleep the first time I watched it so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  
1,The fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  
1,"The best part about ""Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "
1,Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next.  
0,Otherwise don't even waste your time on this.  
0,This one just fails to create any real suspense.  
0,As for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  
1,There is however some pretty good acting (at least for this type of film).  
0,I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  
0,One of the most boringpointless movies I have ever seen.  
0,The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
0,Hated it.  
0,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  
0,I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie!  
0,I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
0,This is not movie-making.  
0,The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is.  
0,So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  
1,I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  
1,I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  
1,Excellent short film.  
1,Hopefully the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film.  
0,I agree with Jessica this movie is pretty bad.  
0,Characters are one-dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  
0,The story line is totally predictable.  
1,Not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  
0,I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
0,Bad characters bad story and bad acting.  
0,Really awful.  
0,Not easy to watch.  
1,Funny clever hip - just like Pray's previous film Hype!  
1,It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  
1,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  
1,The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
1,I rate this movie 9/10.  
1,I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  
1,The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  
1,"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "
1,For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  
1,It never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  
1,The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  
1,They are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with.  
1,This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  
1,The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  
1,The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  
1,"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "
1,This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  
1,Go rent it.  
1,However after finally watching this film I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts I also found myself watching it over and over again.  
1,It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  
1,Brilliance indeed.  
1,But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you.  
1,Think of the film being like a dream.  
1,Simply beautiful.  
1,Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  
1,It's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  
1,It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  
0,"Just whatever you do avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "
0,It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  
0,The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
1,But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
1,"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the ""gadget"".  "
1,I enjoyed it.  
1,I have recommended it to friends.  
1,I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  
1,Both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance.  
1,Their on-screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine.  
1,The film's dialogue is natural real to life.  
1,The writer Gorman Bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  
1,The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  
1,Each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  
1,Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  
1,"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "
1,At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  
1,Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  
1,The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  
0,If you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  
0,This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon) and this one fails everywhere.  
0,If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
1,Still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  
1,Just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  
0,Instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting.  
1,Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  
1,It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.

1,I keep watching it over and over.  
1,It's a sad movie but very good.  
1,If you have not seen this movie I definitely recommend it!  
1,She is as lovely as usual this cutie!  
1,Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  
1,;) Recommend with confidence!  
1,This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
1,It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  
1,:) Anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  
1,The opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  
1,Fans of the genre will be in heaven.
